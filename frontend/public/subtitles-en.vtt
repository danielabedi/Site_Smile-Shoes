00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.800
I think why front-end
development is different

2
00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:03.690
is you have to work
with designers,

3
00:00:03.690 --> 00:00:05.550
you've got to work
with product managers.

4
00:00:05.550 --> 00:00:07.395
It's fundamentally
very collaborative.

5
00:00:07.395 --> 00:00:11.010
It's got the right-brain
algorithmic thinking

6
00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:12.449
and how to make
things performant

7
00:00:12.449 --> 00:00:14.055
and work and then it's
got the left-brain.

8
00:00:14.055 --> 00:00:17.085
How do you make things
usable and enjoyable to use?

9
00:00:17.085 --> 00:00:19.430
I found my way into
front-end engineering and

10
00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:22.490
now it's like I couldn't
imagine leaving it.

11
00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:31.450
Hello, I'm Benedict Hobart.

12
00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:35.110
People call me Benny. I'm a
software engineer at Meta.

13
00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:36.740
I think a lot of

14
00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:38.210
people that get into
front-end engineering,

15
00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:41.780
they think about
front-end engineering

16
00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:43.715
as an engineering problem
and you're building stuff,

17
00:00:43.715 --> 00:00:45.295
you're solving a problem.

18
00:00:45.295 --> 00:00:47.630
When you're doing is
building products for

19
00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:48.830
people and you're helping

20
00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:51.065
people solve their own problems.

21
00:00:51.065 --> 00:00:52.730
There's a lot of collaboration
that comes with that,

22
00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:54.710
working with designers,
working with PMs.

23
00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:57.020
You're not some
programmer slouched

24
00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:59.455
over a desk typing away all day.

25
00:00:59.455 --> 00:01:00.980
It's highly

26
00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:03.275
collaborative environment
you're stepping into.

27
00:01:03.275 --> 00:01:05.600
I started when I
was fairly young

28
00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:09.535
with building a fan website
for a game called EverQuest.

29
00:01:09.535 --> 00:01:12.080
I first started making
websites around that time,

30
00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:14.890
but I never really considered
it as a career path.

31
00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:17.990
I actually left
building websites and

32
00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:21.350
came back to it
later in university.

33
00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:23.690
I think where I really actually
started treating it like

34
00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:26.180
a career was in my second
year of university,

35
00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:27.740
I had a cool cousin who was

36
00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:29.120
a programmer then he

37
00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:30.605
was like, "You should
do this subject."

38
00:01:30.605 --> 00:01:33.110
What helped me
initially was that I

39
00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:35.860
was building something
I was excited by.

40
00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:37.490
I think it's the practicality

41
00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:39.530
of solving problems
with software,

42
00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:41.600
that was really appealing.

43
00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:43.820
A typical day is I'll start

44
00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:46.485
off working from home

45
00:01:46.485 --> 00:01:48.710
or getting into the office
and reviewing code,

46
00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:50.705
helping, giving advice on

47
00:01:50.705 --> 00:01:52.505
how things could
be built better.

48
00:01:52.505 --> 00:01:55.310
I often have meetings
with designers and

49
00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:58.370
product managers on the
things that we want to build.

50
00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:59.960
I support a lot of

51
00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:02.470
engineers solving the
problems they have.

52
00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:04.620
It's wide and varied
and I think that's

53
00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:06.200
the exciting thing about

54
00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:07.715
getting into
software in general.

55
00:02:07.715 --> 00:02:09.940
There's a lot of space to be

56
00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:11.895
a different type of engineer.

57
00:02:11.895 --> 00:02:14.270
You could get excited
about solving

58
00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:17.390
these really hard technical
challenging problems.

59
00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:18.800
But if you're doing it without

60
00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:21.050
a purpose, I lose motivation.

61
00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:22.820
It's like knowing that

62
00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:24.875
there's someone at the
end of the day I'm hoping

63
00:02:24.875 --> 00:02:27.200
helps me focus my energy
on the problems that

64
00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:29.780
do need to be solved versus
problems that don't.

65
00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:32.000
I've been working on
encrypted messaging,

66
00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:36.590
which is seriously important
for a number of reasons.

67
00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:37.670
You take it very

68
00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:39.860
seriously when you're
building those products

69
00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:44.119
that allow people to communicate
safely and privately.

70
00:02:44.119 --> 00:02:46.295
When you're solving a
really hard problem,

71
00:02:46.295 --> 00:02:48.800
it's easy to think you're
not making any progress.

72
00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:50.780
I think everyone talks

73
00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:53.020
about imposter syndrome
in the industry.

74
00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:54.530
If you're not making

75
00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:56.345
progress and you
putting in these hours,

76
00:02:56.345 --> 00:02:58.070
you start to think,
should I even be there?

77
00:02:58.070 --> 00:02:59.450
Can I solve this problem?

78
00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:02.120
That's a hard thing to get

79
00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:04.920
over and that's probably
the worst part of the job.

80
00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:06.490
Technically, I think
you're going to learn

81
00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:08.255
a lot of what I do
in this course,

82
00:03:08.255 --> 00:03:10.325
going through how to write code,

83
00:03:10.325 --> 00:03:12.275
how to make it work,

84
00:03:12.275 --> 00:03:13.915
how to make it accessible,

85
00:03:13.915 --> 00:03:16.785
and to shipping it to people.

86
00:03:16.785 --> 00:03:19.940
Javascript, HTML CSS, Git,

87
00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:21.320
these are all
foundational that you'll

88
00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:24.815
find across every web
development company.

89
00:03:24.815 --> 00:03:26.330
When it comes to soft skills,

90
00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:27.800
there's a lot of empathy

91
00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:29.840
trying to understand other
people's perspectives.

92
00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:32.120
Engineers, we care
about performance,

93
00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:33.349
we care about accessibility,

94
00:03:33.349 --> 00:03:37.010
we care about things
being correct.

95
00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:40.070
It usually takes engineers
a long time to understand

96
00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:44.150
designer's perspective or
product manager's perspective

97
00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:46.010
because you think
so algorithmically,

98
00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:47.270
you need to solve every problem

99
00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:50.560
versus that 80
percent user problem.

100
00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:52.910
I work with a fantastic designer

101
00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:54.800
who actually jumps
in on the diffs and

102
00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:56.270
I can ask him questions in

103
00:03:56.270 --> 00:03:58.695
the code and he can code a bit.

104
00:03:58.695 --> 00:03:59.985
I was talking about empathy,

105
00:03:59.985 --> 00:04:01.970
he has an understanding
of the work I

106
00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:04.190
do and I've got an understanding
of the work he does.

107
00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:07.880
At the end of the day, it's
good to recognize that you're

108
00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:10.220
a software engineering
and your job is to

109
00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:14.220
bring a lot of their
vision to life.

110
00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:16.760
Likewise, a designer when

111
00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:17.945
get into your code and tell you

112
00:04:17.945 --> 00:04:19.310
how you should best to architect

113
00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:20.635
and structure your code,

114
00:04:20.635 --> 00:04:23.960
you need to give advice and
you're there to support him.

115
00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:26.755
When you find an issue
it's highly collaborative.

116
00:04:26.755 --> 00:04:28.080
A good front-end engineer will

117
00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:30.990
actually dip their
toes into back-end.

118
00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:33.150
Problem-solving is
consistently hard.

119
00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:37.195
Whenever you're learning
and pushing yourself,

120
00:04:37.195 --> 00:04:39.450
you're going to run
into roadblocks.

121
00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:42.000
Best advice is go
easy on yourself.

122
00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:45.440
Going with the mentality
that your goal is to grow

123
00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:50.375
and become a software
engineer or a better person.

124
00:04:50.375 --> 00:04:52.325
Adopting a growth mindset to

125
00:04:52.325 --> 00:04:56.790
developing is going
to be critical.

126
00:04:56.790 --> 00:04:58.020
Find time for yourself.

127
00:04:58.020 --> 00:05:01.220
I mean, it's not my place

128
00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:04.460
to talk about the psychology
of being easy on yourself,

129
00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:06.230
but that's just as
important as any

130
00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:08.755
of the engineering
stuff you learn.

131
00:05:08.755 --> 00:05:11.490
For me personally,
the role grows.

132
00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:13.940
As you build things and
you solve problems,

133
00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:16.090
you get perspective
into other problems

134
00:05:16.090 --> 00:05:19.670
and it's this idea of
growing your scope.

135
00:05:19.670 --> 00:05:22.160
As an engineer yourself,
how do you sort

136
00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:23.990
a list and how do you
drop a list on a page?

137
00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:25.100
How do you make a button work?

138
00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:26.270
By the end of it,

139
00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:28.550
you're working on
encrypted messaging.

140
00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:30.290
I think we're at a really

141
00:05:30.290 --> 00:05:31.690
exciting point in the industry,

142
00:05:31.690 --> 00:05:33.785
there are a lot of new
exciting technologies.

143
00:05:33.785 --> 00:05:36.155
There are a lot of new ways

144
00:05:36.155 --> 00:05:38.000
and new products that
are going to be built in

145
00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:41.570
the next coming
years and finding

146
00:05:41.570 --> 00:05:43.160
those opportunities and solving

147
00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:47.130
new problems is
deeply satisfying.
